# assigment3

Task1:
In the first part of the lab, the entire program is written in Assembly. Eight integer values are stored in the .data section, and the program calculates their average using a custom subroutine. All numbers are summed inside a loop, and the result is divided by eight using bit shifting, since the ARMv6-M processor has no hardware division instruction. The calculated average is then printed forever to the terminal using printf in an infinite loop. This task shows how to work with loops, subroutines, and parameter passing in assembly, as well as how to handle data and perform basic output through stdio.
